At the same time I\\nneeded to start new university-level school, so no\\nwonder I didn\'t have time to chat with all my friends\\nall around Europe. :-( But now! Time to sit down with\\ncomputer and internet.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, it happened so, that I never did Germany! :-D\\n(my original plan was to see Poland and Germany, both\\nfor one month). We travelled to Slovakia with my friend\\n- it was just some random idea, Jonna had about week\\nbefore she needed to go back to Finland. During that\\nweek we met wonderfull people in small cities of\\neast-Slovakia and travelled in Tatra-mountains. We did\\nsome tenting and a bit of hiking.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter that we returned to Krakow, spent some time in\\nthere and seperated to our own directions again. After\\nfew days I was in Prague, going towards Dresden. And\\nWoah; I was wondering, do I really want to go to\\nGermany? Like, mix up these two different worlds - east\\nand west. It\'s great country for sure, I want to go\\nthere, but not just this time. Prague was horrible. So\\nbeautifull city but so crowded by turists. I need to go\\nthere again on better time.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter one night in Prague, I got idea: I\'ll hitchhike\\nto Odessa, Ukraine. It\'s like 2000km but so what. There\\nwas hitchhikers gathering coming up. So rest of my\\njourney included countries like: Czech Republic,\\nSlovakia (again), Hungary, Romania, Moldova and\\nUkraine. From Odessa I travelled back to Poland and\\nspent some time in Vilnius, Lithuania.\\n\\nI\'m planning to start blog in english and translate\\nsome of my previous blog entries. It would be good\\npractise - my new school is in english and it\'s no\\nproblem to speak, but with writing I don\'t feel that\\ncomfortable yet.\\n\\nWhile waiting to tell all those little stories about\\ngreat adventures, here\'s one of the most amazing. With\\nmy friend Jonna, who you also met in Krakow, i\'ve been\\ngood friend for over six years now. It just happend so,\\nthat we needed to go all the way to Slovakia, to see\\nsome stars (and milky way) in the mountains, to fall in\\nlove together. :-) It\'s so funny. Ang great! It\'s going\\nto be complicated, she lives in different city and is\\ngoing to move to Spain for half a year. Again after\\nthat she moves to another city in Finland, even more\\nfar away from Tampere (where I live). So, it\'s going to\\nbe very interesting, and for sure - complicated. You\\nknow facebook\'s \\"relationship status\\"? I just love that\\n\\"It\'s complicated\\"-status. Though, isn\'t it always.\\nNothing is simple when it comes to life and love.\\n\\nMaybe next spring I\'ll travel to Spain for some time\\n(suppose I \\"need\\" to). I contact you if I spent some\\ntime in Germany also while going towards\\nSpain/Finland.\\n\\n\\nSee you, have a GREAT autumn and winter,\\n\\nCiao,\\n\\nMikael\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDwari Cornelia  Drewalowski Wrote:\\n\\n>hey mikael!\\r\\n\\n>\\r\\n\\n>how are you, how is your journey going on?\\r\\n\\n>still with your finnish friend?\\r\\n\\n>\\r\\n\\n>i slowly, slowly arrive here and after two weeks i\\r\\n\\n>allready start to become lazy again..\\r\\n\\n>so, to avoid that i`m thinking about having a trip to\\r\\n\\n>berlin in the end of the month, when i can arrange some\\r\\n\\n>freetime again.\\r\\n\\n>\\r\\n\\n>whats up with you?\\r\\n\\n>allready some plans for a germany trip?\\r\\n\\n>lets do this hiking weekend in siebengebirge, if you\\r\\n\\n>like!\\r\\n\\n>\\r\\n\\n>hope you`re fine,\\r\\n\\n>wishing you the best!\\r\\n\\n>\\r\\n\\n>dwari","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2009-09-02 12:57:28 UTC","updated_at":"2009-09-02 21:26:50 UTC"},{"id":96807789,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":60365666,"author_id":342270,"body":"SUBJECT: Moi!\\n\\nHallo bright mind Dwari! :-)\\n\\nHow\'s life going, I can see you\'re traveling back at your roots?\\n\\nWhat are your plans, gonna stay for some longer time in Warsaw or?

I plan to go to Siauliai from Vilnius at about midday (as at 10 o\'clock I have a job interview - scary)  and there\'s no plan. Maybe just hang around Siauliai for a little while and then head home or visit my grandpa, who lives 30 km next to Siauliai, in Kursenai who I haven\'t seen in ages. So maybe if you have nothing to do you could join me? I guess Siauliai isn\'t all that exiting but raising a hand with thumb held high still doesn\'t sound all that comfortable :D.\\r\\n>>\\r\\n>>Wow, all those distances sound so cool! For instance that Odessa-Rivne one - you must have been in a car (speeding, right?) all the time.\\r\\n>>\\r\\n>>Hope you\'re enjoying Vilnius!\\r\\n>>\\r\\n>>Kamile\\r\\n>>\\r\\n>>Mikael Korpela wrote:\\r\\n>>>Labas!\\r\\n>>>\\r\\n>>>Heh, I guess that distances in here are a bit different thing than in Finland. :-) To \u0160iauliai it ain\'t really that long way, and hitchhiking in baltics is fast\'n\'easy. I\'ve done distances like Prague-Budapest (530km), Vilnius-Tallinn (600km), Tampere-Panevezys (740km) and Odessa-Rivne (900km) in one day. Good luck with hitchhiking! It\'s always a really good thing to go out from your comfort-zone.\\r\\n>>>\\r\\n>>>Oh and our countryside -trip was super great! I\'ve been around Trakai two times and those are great places, but this time we biked to the small polish village called Buikos, about 35km to south from Vilnius.\\r\\n>>>\\r\\n>>>We were floating at the small river with some small styrox-boats during night, \'till 4pm. :-D It was complete darkness and stars over us, even could see the milky way. Just crazy stuff! Next day we did the same and got heavy rain and thunderstorm over us.\\r\\n>>>\\r\\n>>>Mikael\\r\\n>>>\\r\\n>>>\\r\\n>>>Kamil\u0117 Clap wrote:\\r\\n>>>>Hi,\\r\\n>>>>\\r\\n>>>>thanks for the tips. The plan in my head is growing and growing all the time now. I guess I\'ll just try to hitchhike to \u0160iauliai next week. It\'s quite a distance but not as nearly frightening as Northern Europe. If all goes well, I\'m taking the flight there and then try to get back. It\'s just that there\'s gonna be a long way because of it being a peninsula. Oh well, you know you can only learn how to swim if you were thrown in a middle of the lake. Preferably with some sharks around. :) And thanks for the links, they\'re very useful.\\r\\n>>>>\\r\\n>>>>Hope your countryside riding went well! Where did you guys go? I\'ve heard Kernave and Trakai have great biking paths.\\r\\n>>>>\\r\\n>>>>Kamil\u0117\\r\\n>>>>\\r\\n>>>>Mikael Korpela wrote:\\r\\n>>>>>Hola!\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>Nice to hear from you! I realised after I left that I didn\'t took your number or CS-nick. :-) But good that I gave you that card; only it has my finnish number, my LT-number is +37062291941\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>It seems that Norway (like I thought) isn\'t the easiest country to hitchhike http://hitchwiki.org/en/Norway - esp. for the first timer. You could try to do just a short Vilnius-Kaunas-Vilnius one weekend trip to practise. ;-) I could come too, I so want to be on a road again but just don\'t have enough time to travel longer trips too much. But there\'s a lot to see only in Lithuania. :-)\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>If you want to take it certain, would be better to fly first and then come back by HH (and you can always take busses and trains if it doesn\'t work). Flying is so different from hitchhiking, where you don\'t need (or want to) to think about timetables. If first hitchhike and then back by plane, you would need to be back at airport-city a day or few before the departure, to make it for sure.\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>Three things I\'m always having with me when hitchhiking, even I\'m not usually using them: a big black marker to make signs with (though I\'m just too lazy to make some), a flashlight and reflectors. If it gets dark, for safety and for the comfort. Sometimes I\'m carrying a tent if I want to save money and have some comfort when doing longer trips, but I would imagine a hammock+rainblanket would be as good and much lighter. Or then I just don\'t have anything and I trust to be lucky. :-) Or sleeping in a busstop like in Panevezys. :-D Story in here: http://www.ihminen.org/wanderlust/2010/07/this-is-how-it-goes-and-does-not/\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>But it looks like many people have hitchhiked in Norway, at least it\'s really a lot of markers there: http://maps.hitchwiki.org/\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>That old maps site isn\'t too good to use. :-) We\'re making a new one, but it\'ll take few months before it\'s ready (looks like this now http://www.ihminen.org/maps.hitchwiki.org/ ).\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>Oh lala, now to the countryside by bike with some friends. So cool.\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>Mikael\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>Kamil\u0117 Clap wrote:\\r\\n>>>>>>Hey there!\\r\\n>>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>>How\'s your work going? The weather\'s not too hot even to think? Well it is for me. Anyways, I\'ve actually started planning this trip of mine and I got the idea of only taking one flight. So what do you think would be better - to go to Norway and try to hitchhike back or to hitchhike to Norway and have my flight back let\'s say in 2 weeks? Not too much of a risk? Well both have pros and cons and I still think it might a slightly bit too crazy to just go (yes, yes, I guess I\'m looking for encouragement here (flush))\\r\\n>>>>>>\\r\\n>>>>>>Cheers,\\r\\n>>>>>>Kamil\u0117","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2010-07-21 21:45:40 UTC","updated_at":"2010-07-21 22:31:44 UTC"},{"id":94605769,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":93353178,"author_id":1268737,"body":"SUBJECT: HI!\\n\\nHey there,\\n\\nhow was your trip?

Lucky you actually got out of the \'chill zone\' :D Congrats on making arrangement to stay in Vilnius :) First lithuanian winter awaits.\\n\\nAs I was feeling inspired to do traveling and my application to the project I really wanted to go to failed one morning I woke up and started hitchhiking. (pretty big move, huh?) It was more or less Lithuania, went as far as Druskininkai, spent some time there and then got back. For the next time I know that I have to carry less, a lot less books :D\\n\\nAfter this I planned to go to the music festival in Estonia where I was invited by one Estonian couchsurfer. All was arranged, I had to go to Tallinn from there but on the morning of leaving I didn\'t feel good. Just like that. Turned out it\'s pretty serious, something about very low ferrous level in blood so going North will have to wait a bit. Hope it\'s not going to be too long.\\n\\nMeanwhile I found more Ryanair tickets and planned 3 weekend trips in November-December. 2 to Gothenburg and 1 to Tampere :) Together with my south Europe tour which turned out to be 11 (!) flights it\'s gonna be quite busy autumn.\\n\\nWhen are you planning Budapest trip? Don\'t wait too long - it can get quite chilly in late fall (one my friend lives there). Still I bet you\'ll get some amazing time - planning to hh there?\\n\\nOh, this turned out to be long!

(If you\'re coming from the coach station it\'s only a few minutes\' walk so just ask someone.) It\'s a very frequent service and you won\'t have to wait more than a few minutes. The fare will be about \xa32.50 but if you intend on travelling by bus again that day buy a DayRider which is about \xa34. Ask the driver to give you a shout when you get to McVities, which is a biscuit factory, and from there walk back the way you came about three minutes on the same side of the road, until you get to some traffic lights. There will be a pub called the Golden Prague in front of you. Turn right onto a busy road called Broom Lane (I think on the sign the B and R are missing so it just says OOM LANE!) and we are number 9, which is on the other side of the road. Beware the narrow pavement and fast cars!\\n\\n~From the airport~\\nThe first train is 05.37 (08.27 on Sunday). You will change at Manchester. They run throughout the day until 23.14 (22.15 on Sunday).\\nThere are buses run by Trent to Stockport. From there get a 192 to the biscuit factory (McVities) or the Wheatsheaf pub and follow the directions above.\\n\\n*You can also get a train to Levenshulme (it\'s cheaper and faster). You can ask anyone where Broom Lane is (the far end, nearest the biscuit factory)*\\n\\nSo, our address is 9 Broom Lane, Levenshulme, Manchester M19 2TN and my phone number is 00447983725124. On Skype I\'m les-boheme.\\nI might be able to come get you so the directions might not be relevant, but it\'s best to have them just in case! Let me know about when you\'re arriving and I\'ll try to be there.\\nHappy trails!\\n\\nADDRESS:\\n9 Broom Lane\\nManchester, Manchester, M19 2TN\\nEngland\\nPHONE: 00447983725124\\n","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2010-12-09 12:41:35 UTC","updated_at":"2010-12-09 21:20:26 UTC"}]},{"user_ids_concatenated":"342270,1972398","created_at":"2010-12-16 19:48:31 UTC","updated_at":"2010-12-16 20:18:51 UTC","messages":[{"id":111925315,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":111925315,"author_id":1972398,"body":"SUBJECT: Comming to CS Christmas meeting.

This first part is a copy-paste I send to all potential hosts.\\n\\nI dropped my job on Friday and because I\'m starting in new one 17th I decided to go somewhere, not really near and not really far and your country seems to be ideal choice :o) \\nI\'ll be leaving today (hopefully before lunch) so I guess I\'ll be stuck somewhere in Poland for this evening and next evening (7th) I\'ll be in Lithuania.\\nSo... I should write something about me now, but I\'ll be just copy-pasting my profile, so... hm... I watched ninja turtles quite recently. If I\'m going to act retarded you\'ll know the reason now... I don\'t really know what to write, lets just end this stupid part and get to the personal one.\\n\\nWHY I WANT TO MEET YOU\\nHi again,\\nI can see that you\'re hitchhiker and from the references it seems like you\'re really nice guy to talk to. So I was wondering, if your couch would be available at this time and if you feel like hosting people.\\nI\'ll be probably coming to Kaunas 7th during the day, maybe at the evening. Than I want to go to Klaipeda and I want to see your national parks so I guess I can be around 14th in Vilnius. I really don\'t feel like organizing things much this week and that could be really annoying, I know. I just really want to go to highway and say that I\'m going to the north and wait what will happened. But if you\'ll accept and I\'ll say I\'m coming I\'ll come, it\'s not that bad :o) so, hopefully see you in Vilnius\\ncheers\\n\\neva","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2012-09-06 08:46:49 UTC","updated_at":"2012-09-06 08:46:49 UTC"},{"id":200837681,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":200628253,"author_id":342270,"body":"SUBJECT: Eva Pytlounova from Czech Republic sent you a new CouchRequest!\\n\\nHallo!\\r\\n\\r\\nSure, we\'d be happy to host you! \\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t yet know about the weekend tho, we might go to the countryside (you\'re welcome to join!).\\r\\n\\r\\nThursday and Friday we\'ll be working at home, so at least if you arrive before Saturday, we can host you.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy number is +370 622 91 941 and home waits at Rinktines 40A - 22, press 022 from the downstairs.

Shall see how this goes. \\nAlso, I noticed you\'re interested in vegetarian cooking. I\'ve been a veggie for three years now and although I\'m usually just being spontaneous in the kitchen I can share some information about vegetarian diet.\\nAnd for last- you and Simona just seem to be relaxed, happy people- just the perfect kind to meet while on holidays :) \\nSo I hope you can host us for these 2, or at least 1 night.","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2012-10-24 10:17:07 UTC","updated_at":"2012-10-24 10:17:07 UTC"},{"id":207925420,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":207631351,"author_id":342270,"body":"SUBJECT: Loone Vilumaa from Estonia sent you a new CouchRequest!\\n\\nTere Loone!\\r\\n\\r\\nSorry radio silence of couple days - hate to say it but I\'ve been very busy-tired with work this week.

I\'m a 25yo chick from Belgium traveling around the baltic capitals at the end of June. I\'ll be bringing my Canon (and my brand new Gorillapod) with me and really want to walk around Vilnius and try to find nice spots to take a few (more like tons) \xfcber cool pics! A pret-t-y cool way of discovering a city, don\'t you think? Now if you girls feel like flashing around town with me, that\'d be awesome! And host me by any chance, that\'d be even more super-nice! \\n\\nAnyway, I\'ll be coming from Riga, and I\'ll need a place to crash on saturday 29 and sunday 30 of june. On the next day, I\'ll head for Kaunas. If you have time to host me and share a cool evening with me, can you please let me know if one of the two nights (or both?) is okay to stay with you? Thanks a lot Mikael (and Simona :) )\\n\\nWHY I WANT TO MEET YOU\\nWell, your passion for hitchiking amazes me! I\'ve always wanted to do that too for long distances but I\'ve never have. I would love to HH somewhere far, like around Europe, but I wouldn\'t want to do it alone, mostly because I would want someone to share the experience with. I would want to exchange thoughts, share opinions and just ... share. But none of my friends feels up for the job. They like their comfort and they\'re scared. I just wish I had someone like you amongst my friends so I could travel with them! So when I\'m done traveling the baltic countries in 3 weeks, I want to go from Krakow to Warsaw hitchiking. SHouldn\'t be too much of a problem, but a precious advice would def. be welcome! One of my dreams would be to hitchike all the way from Belgium and up to Denmark, but like i said, I need to find someone willing to come with... And I love that you lived in Malaysia too! That\'s a part of the world that I would love to visit! \\n\\nAnyway, you seem like a genuinely interesting person, with tons of experience and tales to tell and a really good spirit! Just the kind of person I like to hang out with. Keep it simple, small joys, easy peasy. I read that you don\'t have much time to host right now but I hope that at least one of the two nights I\'ll be spending in Vilnius will be one night during which you won\'t be too busy so we can meet, even if not to surf your couch, but maybe for a beer or something? Anyway, cheers man!

We are planning a short but saturated trip to Vilnius from November 29 to December 1.

We would love to see it though the eyes of an insider, who knows anti-touristic routes :) There are three of us: my two hilarious friends who are DJs and I (Daria). We\'d appreciate a nice company and will be grateful for a place to lay our heads for two nights :)\\n\\nWHY I WANT TO MEET YOU\\nWhat\'s up, Mikael! Me and 2 charming friends of mine are coming to Vilnius on November 29.

My name\'s Eugene, I\'m from Minsk and I thought it just wouldn\'t be right to stay at home on this super nice upcoming weekend. So I decided to hitchhike to the closest awesome city, which, coincidentally, is Vilnius! My girlfriend Sveta (username: red-haired) loved the idea and she\'s totally on board. And what\'s a better way to make a trip special than to hang out with some cool new people? That\'s right, nothing is.\\n\\nWhat can I tell you about us, aside from what we have on our profiles? Even though we have our day jobs in IT, we both love to travel on every opportunity, we\'re both hitchhikers (I\'m much better at it, but don\'t tell her I said it!). I hitchhiked a total of 13 countries in Europe and Caucasus and had some incredible (in my book, that is) experiences in the process.

But you seem super awesome and like you\'ve have a lot of experience hitchhiking, so I figured I\'d try contacting you (and it\'s totally understandable if you don\'t reply, though a little sad hahaha). But anyway, in June I\'m leaving Germany and want to travel for three months, before I have to go back to Canada, so I can see as many badass places as possible while I\'m here! I start by flying to London (for visa reasons), then to Lisbon a week later and from there it is an open itinerary. HOWEVER, ideally I would like to travel through Spain, southern France, Italy, Czech, Poland, back into northern Germany, and then fly from Berlin to Oslo, and hitchhike back down through Norway (Sweden depending on the time and money available) and Denmark, then return to Stuttgart a couple days before my flight leaves on the 25th of August. Hahaha SO my main questions now are: \\r\\n\\r\\n- I\'ve hitchhiked once before in Canada from Fredericton, New Brunswick to Halifax, Nova Scotia and back. It was awesome and super fucking easy to get picked up (even in November) BUT I did it with my friend who is a guy. Do you think it will be possible to hitchhike through these places in three months? I\'m a musician too and usually can make quite good money so in worse case scenarios I have a bit of back up money and a way to make enough for at least like, food, for survival hahahaha. \\r\\n\\r\\n- Second, I am wondering if you think it\'s too dangerous to hitchhike to Morocco alone. I kind of feel like it is. Well, I\'m nervous about it hahaha. But I would love to head to Morocco from Spain! \\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, I just feel like you would have a good opinion on these things. I\'ve traveled so far just to France, Netherlands, Belgium (and well of course Germany) alone but never done any hitchhiking here. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks a bunch in advance! Oh and I signed up for that trustroots website a few days ago haha so maybe I can put it to good use on my travels :) \\r\\n\\r\\n","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2015-01-26 18:58:53 UTC","updated_at":"2015-01-26 18:58:53 UTC"}]},{"user_ids_concatenated":"342270,2000445077","created_at":"2015-01-31 23:12:59 UTC","updated_at":"2015-01-31 23:21:16 UTC","messages":[{"id":329514277,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":321859143,"author_id":2000445077,"body":"Hi my friend how are you I m new member here I m from Iran nice to meet you","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2015-01-31 23:12:59 UTC","updated_at":"2015-01-31 23:12:59 UTC"},{"id":329514430,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":321859143,"author_id":2000445077,"body":"my name is hadi maleki please send me a text or sth\\r\\n","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2015-01-31 23:14:32 UTC","updated_at":"2015-01-31 23:14:32 UTC"},{"id":329514699,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":321859143,"author_id":2000445077,"body":"can I invite you to visit my country ? my country is one of the cheapest country in the world with amazing  place and kind people...","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2015-01-31 23:17:11 UTC","updated_at":"2015-01-31 23:17:11 UTC"},{"id":329515057,"system_message":{},"message_thread_id":321859143,"author_id":2000445077,"body":"here is mid night I need to go to sleep . if you deside to send me  a massage do it two hours earlier. \\r\\nthank you my brother","deleted_at":null,"created_at":"2015-01-31 23:21:16 UTC","updated_at":"2015-01-31 23:21:16 UTC"}]},{"user_ids_concatenated":"43754,342270","created_at":"2015-02-16 17:06:44 UTC","updated_at":"2015-02-17 10:32:19 UTC","messages":[{"id":332217568,"system_message":{"type":"cv_c","id":49112516,"a":{"status":0,"arrival":"2015-02-21 11:00:00 UTC","departure":"2015-02-23 11:00:00 UTC"}},"message_thread_id":322799957,"author_id":342270,"body":"Hey!\\r\\n\\r\\nI just asked our common friend Olexandr if he knows anyone fun to meet in Stockholm and he said yea he indeed does know one pirate residing over there!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo; me and my girlfriend are long term hitchhikers (I\'m even coding hitchwiki.org, perhaps you know it?) and all around well travelled, cool and fun people et all that, ya know. ;-) It seems like we\'ve got plenty in common!

I might sound weird but I\'ve been looking for an excuse to send this message for quite a while. I see your are supposed not to accept guests so don\'t consider this as a request itself.\\n\\nHow to begin? Well, I believe there are certain people who are intended to cross their paths in some point of their life. Sometimes you can just let that happen naturally or some other times you can take advantage of new technologies to make it by your own. My story for being right now writing this request to the co-founder of some of my favourite and most used websites for traveling starts three years ago in the woods of Minsk when I met a person who would influence my life till the point of being where I am nowadays. I\'m not going to go into details but basically that person is from Vilnius, and she lives there atm. I\'ve been trying to figure out a reason to come back again and visit her as we used to meet twice a year during two years but due to many reasons we haven\'t met each other since January 2016.\\n\\nReasons to come to Vilnius and pretend that she\'s not\u200b the main one? Well, I have some other friends from Vilnius. I recently became mentor of a girl from Kaunas who loves hitchhiking which might give me a reason to pass through. I could also argue that I basically love Vilnius and I just want to get the stamp from Uzupis on my passport and a long etcetera, but at the end of the day she\'s\u200balways the reason.\\n\\nBut this time the story changes. I know who you are (please don\'t get scared) and I know what you do. I\'ve seen your support on different Facebook groups of hitchhikers and specially on the one we\'re currently trying to develop for hitchhiking in Spain. I honestly appreciate people like you and I have a list of dudes from who I have learned a lot and I\'m quite sure you could get into it.\\n\\nIn this point of the request I\'m going to introduce myself so you can get a better view of me rather than a guy who knows how to please strangers. At the moment I\'m sleeping an average of 4-5 hours a day due to combining full time studies in a foreign country with two and a half part-time jobs and an incredibly huge social life. I basically tend to keep myself busy which is what I like.

Each day that we plan to make the project I will post it in the Granada group, so you can either take it or leave it, but once you are in, you have to be respectful with the choice of the day.\\n2- We have to visit every bar in the street, no matter if you don\u2019t like the style or whatever, we visit every, because the idea is to get to know all the bars.\\n3- We only have one drink, in order to have time to see all the bars in the street in one night. \\n4- If you come, you have to participate in the review, and sign at the end of the journey.\\n5- You can come whatever day you like, but if you come, it is better if you stay till the end of the night (this is not really a problem due to the concept of bar, bars don\u2019t close very late, no fear for sleepy people)\\nOh! Just to let you know: we\u2019ll only go to bars, coffee-shops, restaurants, pubs or clubs don\u2019t count. We consider bar a: bar, caf\xe9-bar, tavern or similar.\\n\\n\\nP.S. if you have any doubt, write me a message, I will answer delightfully.\\n\\n","created_at":"2012-01-14 11:48:29 UTC","updated_at":"2015-04-02 19:27:40 UTC","deleted_at":null,"privacy":"default","slug":"bar-project","user_groups_count":108},{"creator_id":0,"title":"BeWelcome","description":"To all who already belongs to or is about to belong to BE WELCOME!

(Kasper and me are both from the Trustroots team)\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Bluedragon for a very thoughtful and analytical initial post! I really appreciate it a lot.\\r\\n\\r\\nMocki and Annarital: \\r\\nYou don\'t necessarily have to join tribes and you can join multiple tribes. You can keep hosting anyone and be hosted by anyone who won\'t \\"sandbox\\" themselfs into tribes. We expect most of the people remain to be open for anyone, at leat while number of members stays relatively low.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the future there will be indefinite number of Tribes, one for each of your sides of identity/hobby/community. Of course, nobody is simple, everyone\'s life is immensely complex. :-) In future members will create new Tribes by themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'re sticking to smaller number of tribes initially to stop limited amount of members (16K+ and growing) from scattering into too small groups, which would make it harder to actually find people. We might add a few most requested tribes though before opening it up completely.\\r\\n\\r\\n>\\"the choices of the initial 12 tribes don\'t seem that coherent to me, ranging from identity (LGBT) via lifestyle (Vegan/Vegetarian) to interests (Lindyhoppers). Some also seem duplicates: do Musicians, Buskers, Punks and Lindyhoppers really need to be 4 different tribes?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI know it might seem odd selection, but It\'s really carefully considered and as Kasper wrote, we didn\'t want to stick only to one \\"type\\". I\'ll elaborate this a bit more:\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically we\'re still learning some aspects of this feature and we want to see what kind of tribes attract people easier via viral spread (will \\"identity\\" or \\"lifestyle\\" work better?) and what kind of tribes we can get to grow via more active promotion inside very specific communities (interests). That\'s what we basically did witch Hitchhikers. What type of tribes people will start using to search members?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou might see sudden growth peak on numbers of some specific interest tribe, which might seem odd if you don\'t even know what that interest means. :-) But it makes sense from broader perspective.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also intentionally wanted to have some overlap between tribes: \\r\\n- For one because we\'re still lacking the actual search function \u2014 we\'re working on it \u2014 right now we prefer to have a community with more or less similar interests. \\r\\n- Secondly to be able to start doing tests for the search. Searching \\"Musicians\\" should probably somehow bring you up also \\"Buskers\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes the current selection of tribes make more sense to you now? :-)\\r\\n\\r\\n>\\"I think the term \'tribe\' is a little unfortunate, as is the way that the team appear to be linking it to the notion of a trust network: can we really say that a musician will justifiably find it easier to trust another musician than a non-musician?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA valid point! Might be we should consider our wording to be more clear. It signifies that people tend to step up to help and share with likeminded people more easily. Someone who\'s not open for hosting in general, might all of a sudden be ready to trust and open their door for a fellow hobbyist. You can observe this happening at WarmShowers.org \u2014 many of those people are hosting only via WS and stay away from more generic networks. We would be excited to do some actual science regarding this later on.\\r\\n\\r\\n>\\"Congrats to the TR team for what seems to be careful thinking about how to shape and control growth - in such sad contrast to CS\' experience.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you!
