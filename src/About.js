        <h3>I see only some names, but not everyone?</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the Couchsurfing export doesn't contain names of other
          profiles, only user IDs. There are a few names available from "couch
          requests", which then we can show elsewhere too.

          Could be! Please check the "raw" tab of your profile to browser what
          the file actually contains and what we are showing.

          The preview doesn't show everything, but also the file from
